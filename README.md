Simple page navigation sample


Demonstrates three basic scenarios in 4 commits
- 7b7be86 page routing, e.g. '#/login'
- 1d704b5 credential caching, JSON encoding & decoding, localStorage
- 8a055a6 protected pages, e.g. '#/settings'
- a3f88f2 load cached ccredentials via flags

Made it look nicer
- ec1a803 theme w/ bootstrap 4.3

Also, some rudimentary unit tests
- elm-explorations/test module usage, mostly covering JSON and Routing cases
